0. Idle
-1. Idle with monitor, keyboard and mouse
-2. Idle without hat
1. A heart beat signal to inform user the device is functioning
2. A tamper-proof temperature sensor data collection application that verifies for location, time and sign before displaying results
3. A high frequency soil-moisture sensor data collection application that represents oversampling
4. A low priority humidity sensor data collection application that represents user directed prioritization
5. A gps sensor data reporting application that represents a sensor that is generally not useful but becomes high priority if the sensor hub is moved
6. A non-existent CO2 sensor data collection application that represents device failure
7. A faulty atmospheric pressure sensor data collection application that represents sensors with energy bugs
8. A light sensor data collection, high-energy consuming application that represents applications with energy bugs
